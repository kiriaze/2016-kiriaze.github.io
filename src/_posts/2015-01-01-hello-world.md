hello world. hello, world?

Its been a while since i've been on.
Three years exactly.

I fucking did it. Finally.

I wanted something minimal, clean, &amp; simple - let the content speak for itself. I wanted a place to experiment, write and post random musings, and an elegant way to display my works, all wrapped up together seamlessly and within a system thats easy to manage, update, and super fast.

I created a minimal site based on Jekyll, gulp, bower &amp; NPM. Quite different from what I've been used to developing in, coming from back end tech in the likes of php + mysql, mainly wordpress, and using Codekit for all the front end optimizations. It's quite refreshing switching to a "static" site, and don't get me wrong - Codekit is awesome - props to [Bryan Jones](http://incident57.com/codekit/)! - but not every developer I came across had access to Codekit, and thus the jump to open tools like Gulp ( the better Grunt ), Node &amp; Jekyll came about.

Why Jekyll, and not X, Y or Z, or even plain old Markdown? Jekyll is configured for blogs right out the box, and with a few tweaks it became perfect for portfolio use - eventually churning out this system into a front end framework named [Juice](/juice) - which you should check out!

My portfolio is currently hosted on Github, entirely open sourced for all those curious, and optimized even further with Cloudflare - which I write about [here](/labs/juice) on how I got 99/100 pagespeed results.

After countless revisions, scrapping it all and starting from scratch, it's finally live and it feels awesome. Feel free to give me feedback on it and let me know if you think I can improve it any way!
