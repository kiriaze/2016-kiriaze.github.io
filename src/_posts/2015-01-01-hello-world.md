hello world. hello, world?

its been a while since i've been on.
three years exactly.

come take a peak inside my world - full of random thoughts, music, projects, experiments and other dope stuff.

hello? are you still there?

hold that thought. brb.




I recently took down my portfolio as it felt outdated and wasn't really me anymore.
I put a few placeholders up and explored different designs but I was really trying to create something that I consider minimal, clean and nice to look at.
I wanted a blog and I wanted the new site to be based around the blog.
I didn't want to push my work on to people like how my old portfolio was, so I'm still trying to figure that bit out and have just scrapped the work section all together (you can still see my github, codepen and dribbble â€” check the footer).


## GETTIN' SHIT DONE.

I f*cking did it.
I created a minimal Jekyll theme and experimented with different types of colors, typography and general elements (navigations, forms etc).
I'm not over the moon by the outcome but I'm pretty much pumped that I've consistently managed to focus on designing and building this site.
You see designing personal sites for me is one of the hardest things ever.
Whilst I work on client work I constantly think to myself "Oh man, I wish I was working on a personal site right now, I'd have so much freedom" but in reality when I get to make a personal site I get so overwhelmed with trying to make everything ridiculously perfect and cool I forget about the freedom stuff and just end up rushing the project.
Even though this site in theory has taken over 4 months to design (there has been around 5-6 revisions), I can honestly say that I've kept it real and allowed myself to have the freedom I always wanted.


As I said the site is built on Jekyll and written in LESS (I'll explain why I chose this in another post soon).
After writing numerous notes and filling my trello board with tasks, it is live and it feels great.
Feel free to give me feedback on it and let me know if you think I can improve it any way.


Thanks for reading :)
