Juice was made to simplify the production of websites by automating tasks such as minification, compression, live reloading, cross device syncing, and more all built with the simplest asset package manager, the best css preprocessor, and the fastest streaming build system.

Juice is the best place to start your next static web project. Amazing features without the unessecary bloat other frameworks have. A responsive framework optimized for the multi-screen web, with a high PageSpeed performance score. Simple, clean, and fast.

It has recently been updated to utilize Jekyll, and thus no longer optimal for non static sites. If you're looking for a CMS solution, try [PressPlay](http://github.com/kiriaze/PressPlay), [simple-framework](http://github.com/kiriaze/simple-framework), or [simple-child](http://github.com/kiriaze/simple-child).
