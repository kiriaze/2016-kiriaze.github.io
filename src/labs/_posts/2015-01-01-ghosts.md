### Does 3 things, sometimes 4.

- Creates an instance of your project within your hosts file, e.g. project.dev 127.0.0.1.
- Creates a reference to the hosts/project within httpd-vhosts.conf by referencing your desired path to project.
- Creates directory for you project. (Optional)
- Restarts Apache.

`bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiriaze/ghost/master/ghosts.sh)`

### Preferred method would be to:

Download it and place it with your other scripts, e.g. `/Users/{username}/Documents/Scripts/ghosts.sh`
Make it executable `chmod u+x ghosts.sh`
Create an alias: `nano .bash_profile`
Add alias `alias ghosts="/Users/kiriaze/Documents/scripts/ghosts.sh"`
Run it: `ghosts`
Apply changes to bash file: source ~/.bash_profile
And follow the inline instructions through CLI!
