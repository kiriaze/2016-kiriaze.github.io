Hello, my name is Constantine Kiriaze &amp; I am a San Diego based web engineer with a passion for creating memorable experiences.

With over eight years of experience as a developer, I have had the pleasure of working with a diverse group of clients, ranging from but not limited to non profits, startups, agencies, resorts, small and large shops, news portals and even marketing sites.

I love what I do, and when I'm not found behind a screen, I'm most likely working on or riding one of my motorcycles, reading, traveling, eating, chillin, hacking, working out or catching up on some much needed zzz.

I'm currently freelancing full-time, but I'm always looking forward to new projects and experiences - if you want to know more about me or want to work with me, <a href="mailto:hello@kiriaze.com">let's talk!</a>

<!-- I started tinkering in web design in 2005 and I’m basically self-taught. Back then I was making myspace band pages - that’s right =) - and sites for small businesses. In 2008 I began taking a multimedia degree at Platt College in San Diego, recieving my Bachelors in Multimedia Design &amp; Communication.

During my degree I took a six month internship as a front-end dev, and at the end of my degree I got offered a Front-End position at another agency. I was later offered the position of Art Director there while still orchestrating their front-end development.

I left that position in search of something more meaningful, and found 5ifty&amp;5ifty where I became the Lead Developer, working with non profits around the world to help extend their reach, leading multiple projects with heavy emphasis in accessible, unique and mobile optimized experiences built with wordpress.

After my fill of the non profit world, I returned to the agency life where I was offered the Lead Developer position at Grizzly, and was later promoted to Technial Director. I’ve worked with many awesome clients ranging from artists, surf / snow industries &amp; resorts, global marketing companies, you name it. I've crafted custom network sollutions build on ssd cloud servers for clients to ensure their business needs were surpassed and that high traffic would never hinder their sites performance. I mentored developers and designed frameworks and systems to streamline efficiency, workflows and improve upon our industry standards.
