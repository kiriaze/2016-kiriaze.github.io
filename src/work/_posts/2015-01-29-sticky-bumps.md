		<h6>Seamless Integration</h6>
		<h2>Custom WordPress / Magento Experience.</h2>
		<p>
			We built an intuitive custom website running on Wordpress and an enterprise web store running on Magento. The WP marketing site was integrated into the shop through the Magento API, and the whole experience was customized for Sticky Bumps' ease of use.

		<h6>The Scent</h6>
		<h2>Wrap it up.</h2>
		<p>
			As much as they’d like to say it’s all about performance, there’s something about the original blueberry scent of Sticky Bumps that makes it instantly recognizable and extremely well-loved. A few of their customers have even asked them to formulate a Sticky Bumps perfume.

		<h6>Snag &amp; Grab</h6>
		<h2>A New Wax Concept.</h2>
		<p>
			Every handcrafted bar of high quality surf and ski wax is poured and processed in their 10,000 square foot California factory.
			The term refers to how surf wax sticks to the board and begins to build up small, sticky bumps as you’re waxing it. Rather than smearing all over one’s board, a new additive in Sticky Bumps in 1992 changed the game completely.

				<h6>Device Agnostic</h6>
				<h2>Lookin' Good Bud.</h2>
				<p>
				We made sure the StickyBumps site not only worked on all platforms and devices, but that it looked and functioned great.
				Our research showed that the StickyBumps competitors websites were often slow and unusable, let alone accessible on other devices. Analytics showed that 80% of their traffic was from mobile devices. So we made certain StickyBumps mobile experience was pleasant and fast on every device.

				<h6>Let's not forget</h6>
				<h2>The Shop.</h2>
				<p>
				While user context is important, leaving the right impression about the surf and wax culture is crucial.

				We wanted to spark people's interest and drive them to the shop
				from within the content.

				StickyBumps took a strategic decision to work with WordPress/Magento, which gave them a simple method for managing their web content and the shop the ability to handle their large inventory.

				While cool photography, athelete profiles, and awesome grid styles make the site attractive, the main focus is their shop. We seamlessly blended the shop and the core site together to remove any feeling of separation.
